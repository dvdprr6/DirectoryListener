# DirectoryListener

This is a generic Directory Listener to listen to files that are dropped into a specified directory. This is only a skeleton, meaning it does not include the implementation to handle the file. This directory listener will handle any file size.

## Constants

Constants.java has two configuration variables to start off the listener.
